# City_simulation
A undergraduate project within the context of web development course. A simulation of parking in a city was implemented based on sensors. The sensor data was hypotheticaly generated.


The project offers a login form where the admin separates himself from a simple user.
      
      #ADMIN
      * Loads geographical data into database, as polygons of a KML file. The parser can implemented serverside using kmlparser.php or at will using kmlparser.py
      * Deletes data from database
      * Depicts polygons into the map
      * Can alter the polygon data, such as parking spot or free space probability
      * Depicts in map simulation results given the hypothetical sensor data at a given time, as differnet polygon colours depending the propability of free parking spot
